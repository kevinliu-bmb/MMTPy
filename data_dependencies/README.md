***This directory contains resources sourced from Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH), contributor Isabella Goodchild-Michelman, as well as data that was compiled by the author, Kevin Liu. These files are primarily used in match_names_to_vmh.py for the mapping of non-standard GC-MS output metabolite names to VMH identifiers.***
